If you're taking a look at this repository, this repo is for me to practice and fine tune my skills in TypeScript under Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course in Udemy 'Understanding TypeScript - 2020 Edition'

This course teaches the very basics of TS to the point where I'm able to use TS in any of the projects.

This repo contains my notes as I understand TypeScript to be. This is a practice repo where I can truly polish my skills. TypeScript is new to me and I'm eager and keen to learn this new language!
